Similar to chess, I have labeled the horizontal in alphabets, a, b, c, d, and e, and verticals in numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. So the board goes from a1 to e5.\nEach square is labeled as a character in the alphabet in increasing order. For example\na1 -> a\nb1 -> b\nc1 -> c\nd1 -> d\ne1 -> e\na2 -> f\nb2 -> g\nc2 -> h\nand so on.\n\nThe following sentence has been encrypted using the above notation:\n\nc2-e1 c5-a1-d3-e4-e1-d1 b5-e1-c4-e5 b1-a1-d1-b3-e5 e4-e3 d4-a5-c4-b5-d2-b5-e1-.\n\nDecode the sentence."}

Similar to chess, I have labeled the horizontal in alphabets, a, b, c, d, and e, and verticals in numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. So the board goes from a1 to e5.\nEach square is labeled as a character in the alphabet in increasing order. For example\na1 -> a\nb1 -> b\nc1 -> c\nd1 -> d\ne1 -> e\na2 -> f\nb2 -> g\nc2 -> h\nand so on.\n\nThe following sentence has been encrypted using the above notation:\n\nd2-d5-c3-e4 d5-d3-e3 c5-e5-b2-b2 e4-b3 a1-c5-a5 z-e1-e4-b3-, b4-d5-e2 d2-c1-a1-e4-'-a4 c1-b1-e3-d1 d2-e4-e1-e3 d4-d1-e1-'-d4 a4-e4-z-d2-.\n\nDecode the sentence."}
