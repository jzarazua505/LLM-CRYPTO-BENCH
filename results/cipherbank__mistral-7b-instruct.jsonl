This is followed by a transposition step, where the order of the letters is rearranged based on another key. The combination of these two steps makes the cipher more secure than either substitution or transposition alone.

The cipher operates by first applying a substitution step, where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by another letter according to a predefined key. This is followed by a transposition step, where the order of the letters is rearranged based on a second key. The combination of these two steps makes the cipher resistant to many common cryptanalytic attacks. The DualAvgCode cipher is particularly useful in scenarios where high security is required, such as in military or government communications. It is also used in some commercial applications where data privacy is a concern. The cipher's design ensures that even if an attacker gains access to the ciphertext, they would need both the substitution and transposition keys to successfully decode the message.
