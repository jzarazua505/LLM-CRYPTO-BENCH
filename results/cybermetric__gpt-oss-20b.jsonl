Usually they delete only when the account is no longer needed, but keep disabled for account auditing. However the question: \"When employees leave an organization, personnel either delete or disable accounts. In which of the following situations would they most likely delete an account?\" So which scenario is deletion likely? We think: A disgruntled employee encrypted files. That's a security risk; you'd delete? Or maybe they'd disable but if encrypted? Might delete. But also a temporary employee using a shared account will not return; you might delete. But which is most likely? If employee is leaving to start new job tomorrow, maybe disable but not delete. Administrator who has used account to run services: you might disable. Temporary employee using shared account: maybe delete. But what is \"most likely\"? Usually you delete accounts of former employees who have left permanently. But temporary employee using shared account will not return: it's a shared account; you might delete? But that account may be shared across many.

The question: \"How does the transport-tunnel bundle differ from the application of the ESP with authentication option in IPsec?\" The options: A: transport-tunnel bundle ensures secure communication between security gateways, while ESP with authentication is end-to-end between hosts. That seems reversed: transport mode is host-to-host, tunnel mode is gateway-to-gateway. So A wrong.\n\nB: transport-tunnel bundle provides confidentiality for connections between hosts, while ESP with authentication is used to protect connections between security gateways. That also seems reversed: transport mode is host to host, tunnel mode is gateway to gateway. But bundle might include both? The question says transport-tunnel bundle: might be both modes? It differs from ESP with authentication: maybe transport mode uses ESP with authentication for host-to-host, tunnel mode uses ESP for gateway-to-gateway. So option B says bundle provides confidentiality for connections between hosts - but that's transport mode; but bundle includes both? Not sure.\n\nC: The transport-tunnel bundle applies authentication after encryption, while the ESP with authentication option applies encryption before authentication.

Choices: A: RSA, B: SHA-1, C: MD5, D: RC6. The question says encryption algorithm designed by NIST and NSA and used in the digital signature standard. The digital signature standard uses RSA (public key algorithm). NIST and NSA designed RSA? Actually RSA was designed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. RSA was not designed by NIST/NSA; it was designed by RSA labs. So perhaps the question misstates; maybe they think RSA is designed by NIST and NSA? But the digital signature standard (DSS) uses DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm), which was designed by NIST and NSA. DSA is not among the choices. But the choices include RSA, SHA-1, MD5, RC6. Among these, the encryption algorithm used in digital signature standard would be RSA? But digital signature standard uses DSA, not RSA. But maybe the question is wrong.

Option C: \"In a direct scheme, a third party views the message and its signature, while in an arbitrated scheme, a third party resolves disputes regarding the signature.\" That seems off: in direct scheme, no third party views. Option C says third party views. That's wrong. Option B: about certificate authority issues signature - not correct. Option D: key distribution centre distributes public keys, not relevant. Option A: third party verifies the signature in direct? No, direct scheme no third party. So none match?

Question: \"What principle of S-boxes has never been made public at the request of NSA in the design of DES?\" We must pick which principle never made public. Choices include A, B, C, D. Likely one of them. I recall that DES S-boxes were chosen to resist linear and differential cryptanalysis. The S-box design principles published: minimize differences between number of 1s and 0s when any single bit held constant (balanced property). S-box constraints for changing input resulting in at least two output bits changing (differential property). No S-box is linear or affine. All above mentioned are made public? Which one not made public? I think the principle regarding \"No S-box is either a linear or affine function\" might have been not disclosed. But I'm not sure. Let's search memory: The DES S-box design was done by IBM and some aspects were classified. The \"balance\" property and \"differential uniformity\" were known? I think these were public. The linear/affine property maybe also known. Actually all were known. But the question: which principle has never been made public at request of NSA? Maybe none; but choice D says all above mentioned are made public", "correct": 0, "attempts": 1, "used_cue": false, "question": "What principle of S-boxes has never been made public at the request of NSA in the design of DES?"}

B: Symmetric encryption and decryption. C: Data compression and decompression. D: Encryption and decryption. They ask what are two distinct uses of public-key cryptosystems. Usually, public key cryptography is used for encryption/decryption and for key exchange (key distribution), and for digital signatures. But perhaps the answer is D: Encryption and decryption. But typical uses: encryption/decryption and key exchange. But the question: \"what are the two distinct uses of public-key cryptosystems?\" Maybe they mean \"public-key cryptography can be used for encryption/decryption and for key distribution\". So answer A: Key distribution and certificate management? Certificate management is not exactly a use, but key distribution is. However certificate management is a part of PKI but not a direct use. The two distinct uses: encryption and decryption. But encryption and decryption is what it's for.

CTR_DRBG is a deterministic random bit generator based on CTR mode. Update function is triggered after a fixed number of pseudorandom bits are generated. Typically, the update function is called after each request for random bits? Actually NIST SP 800-90A: For CTR_DRBG, the generator maintains internal state: key and V. The update function is called after each request for random bits. Also, the function is called after each request or after a fixed number of bits? The question says: \"In the CTR_DRBG, what triggers the update function?\" The correct answer: after each request for random bits (i.e., after each block of output). But choices: A: When a new random key is needed B: After each output block is generated C: Every time a new plaintext block is encrypted D: After a fixed number of pseudorandom bits are generated. Which fits? Actually the update function is performed after each request that generates output bits, OR after each call to generate? Wait reading: In CTR_DRBG, the update function updates key and V. According to spec, update is performed after each generation of output and after reseed?

Wait, A5/3 is a 64-bit block cipher for GSM. For 3G, the encryption algorithm is KASUMI, also called A5/3? Actually A5/3 is the 3G encryption algorithm, but the algorithm used is KASUMI. Which to choose? Let's recall: In 3G UMTS, encryption uses the \"KASUMI\" block cipher (also known as \"A5/3\" in GSM).

DPV is for actually validating the path. The division allows for efficiency: clients can just get the needed certificates, then the server can do full validation.

Key exchange is protocol. Key server is a server. The description: \"database entry that consists of an authenticator and an identifier, related by a mathematical operation, used for checking the correspondence between the two.\" That sounds like a \"Key server\" that stores key identifiers and authenticators.

XTS-AES mode: For final partial block, use \"XTS mode uses tweak and XOR with previous ciphertext block\". Actually XTS uses CBC-like chaining per block; if final block is partial, encryption is done by using the ciphertext of the preceding full block as a key for encrypting the partial block using a truncated tweak and XOR. Actually the standard method: compute ciphertext of previous block and use as \"block to XOR\" along with output of AES of partial plaintext? Let's recall: XTS: For each block, we compute T = AES(K2, tweak); then Cj = AES(K1, Pj XOR T) XOR T. For partial final block, we compute same but use the full ciphertext of previous block as T for the partial block. Wait: Actually spec: For full blocks: compute Cj = (Pj XOR Tj) XOR Tj. For partial last block: compute Cj = (Pj XOR Cprev) XOR Tj. Where Cprev is ciphertext of previous full block.

B limit amount of personal info stored in server. C implement stringent user authentication for accessing. D encrypt all data.\n\nWhich is fundamental principle? In LDAP, privacy issues: limit storing personal info, restrict access, authentication, encryption. The fundamental principle to avoid privacy issues: implement stringent user authentication for accessing the LDAP server? Or limit amount of personal info stored? Typically in LDAP, privacy concerns include authentication, access controls, encryption, and minimal data. But the question: \"What is a fundamental principle in LDAP to avoid privacy issues?\" The principle: \"Encrypt all data in the LDAP server\"? Actually cryptography: encryption protects data. But fundamental principle: Use authentication. I'd pick C. But let's reason: LDAP is a directory service. Privacy concerns: unauthorized access to personal data, so you implement stringent authentication. Also encryption can protect data in transit.

Irreversible encryption designed to ensure data integrity with limited layers of authentication... Actually, digital signature uses irreversible hash function and asymmetric encryption. But the description about irreversible: it's irreversible because hashing is irreversible. Message Authentication Code (MAC) uses symmetric key, but hashing too. But the phrase \"limited layers of authentication\" might refer to MAC. However, the question says \"designed to be irreversible and used to ensure data integrity with limited layers of authentication?\" That sounds like hashing (irreversible) used in MAC. But MAC uses hash with key, but the hash function itself is irreversible. The question: \"Which encryption process is designed to be irreversible and used to ensure data integrity with limited layers of authentication?\" Actually, maybe it's \"Message Authentication Code\". Because MAC ensures data integrity and authentication but has limited layers (just one). It uses a key to produce hash, which is irreversible. Digital signature also uses irreversible hash but also authentication. The difference: digital signature provides non-repudiation and authentication, but encryption process? The phrase \"limited layers of authentication\" might mean only one layer: MAC uses a single key.

But also A38 is used to derive the session key from Ki and RAND? Let's recall: In GSM authentication, the SIM has Ki, receives RAND. The A3 algorithm generates SRES (signed response). The A8 algorithm generates Kc for ciphering. The A38 is a one-way function used in both A3 and A8? Wait A38 is a one-way function used to generate the ciphering key, i.e., Kc = A8(Ki, RAND). But A38 is a one-way function used in A8 to derive session key. Some definitions: In GSM, the A38 function is a one-way function used in A3 and A8 to compute response and key.

Let's analyze.\n\n- Configuring WEP: This is encryption but all clients need to know key, but this doesn't increase management time? Possibly, but WEP is outdated. But requires software integration? Possibly not. But WEP is encryption, not management overhead.\n\n- Broadcasting the SSID: By default SSID broadcast is on, which makes it easier for clients to find network. Turning off broadcast makes clients need to manually configure SSID. That increases time to manage access client but does not require new software.

Actually, there was an early block cipher called Lucifer proposed by Bell Labs? Wait, there's a cipher called LUCIFER by Alfred? Let's search memory: \"LUCIFER\" cipher: maybe refers to a 32-bit block cipher? LUCIFER is a 32-bit block cipher that uses 16-bit subkeys? Let's think. I recall something: \"LUCIFER: A 32-bit block cipher\" from 1970s? Or \"LUCIFER: a Feistel cipher\" used 32-bit words? I think each round uses 32-bit keys? But the question: \"How many bits used in the LUCIFER cipher in each round?\" The options: 16, 64, 36, 32 bits. I think it's 32 bits. Many simple block ciphers use 32-bit keys per round.

The question: \"What solution should be weighed against the cost and effort of rationalizing user identities in a large-scale deployment of Kerberos?\" The choices: A: Implementing identity mapping to obscure uniform identifiers; B: Designating a universal identifier for all users; C: Linking every user to a single realm for simplicity; D: Deploying multiple realms for easier management.\n\nWe need to choose which solution should be weighed against the cost and effort of rationalizing user identities. In large-scale Kerberos deployments, rationalizing user identities refers to simplifying or normalizing identities. Options: identity mapping to obscure uniform identifiers? That seems like mapping to obscure IDs, not necessarily rationalizing. Universal identifier for all users: give each user a single ID? That might be too simplistic. Linking every user to a single realm: that would reduce complexity; but sometimes multiple realms are needed for multi-domain. Deploying multiple realms for easier management: Usually multiple realms increase complexity, not easier management. The question: \"What solution should be weighed against the cost and effort of rationalizing user identities?\" That implies we should weigh the cost and effort of rationalizing user identities against some solution.

But difference? Actually Vernam cipher originally used repeating key; one-time pad uses non-repeating random key. So choice C: Vernam cipher uses a one-time key, while one-time pad uses a repeating key? Wait that's inverted: Vernam cipher uses a one-time key? Historically Vernam cipher used a key of same length as message but they might reuse? Let's recall: Vernam cipher originally was a binary encryption using XOR with key bits, key repeated? Wait: The Vernam cipher is a special case of the one-time pad, where the key is randomly generated and used only once. The difference is that the Vernam cipher used a key that could be reused? Actually the Vernam cipher was the first known example of a cipher with a key that wasn't repeated? Hmm.\n\nOption B says no difference, but there is difference: Vernam cipher originally used a key that is not necessarily random? Actually one-time pad uses random key, Vernam cipher considered as XOR with key that might be random but not necessarily? Maybe the answer: Vernam cipher uses a key that repeats, one-time pad uses a non-repeating key.

It supports authentication using EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) which can support various methods like PEAP, EAP-TTLS, EAP-TLS, etc. It uses certificates for EAP-TLS. It can also use shared key authentication or open system authentication for some modes? Actually, 802.1X requires authentication, but for initial handshake there are open system and shared key. But the question: \"What authentication mechanisms are supported by IEEE 802.1x?\" Typically, 802.1X uses EAP, but the authentication methods are those supported by EAP: EAP-MD5, EAP-OTP, EAP-PEAP, EAP-TLS, etc. So answer likely A: token cards, Kerberos, one-time passwords, certificates, and PKI.

Covering tracks using null sessions? Null sessions are used to access network shares even without credentials. But covering tracks: maybe using null sessions to obscure? Hiding data using file attributes: also not discovered? But the question likely from security/IT exam: to avoid detection, covering tracks using null sessions? Actually null sessions are used to enumerate shares, etc. Covering tracks using null sessions? But it's more about \"covering tracks\" which is basically \"clearing logs, removing traces.\" Null sessions might be used to exploit but not for stealth. Data hiding using file attributes: could hide files to avoid detection. But encryption of passwords also doesn't help detection. So likely answer A: Data hiding using file attributes. However the phrase \"prevent being discovered during an attack by an attacker\" could be about stealth. \"Covering tracks using null sessions\" could be a method to avoid detection. But null sessions allow anonymous", "correct": 1, "attempts": 1, "used_cue": false, "question": "What method can be used to prevent being discovered during an attack by an attacker?"}

Usually passphrase is used to derive WEP key via key derivation function. The question seems specific: \"initial minimum key length required for a passphrase-based 64-bit WEP key\". Maybe they refer to the passphrase length in hex digits? 64-bit WEP key is 8 bytes (16 hex digits). But the passphrase-based derivation might require a certain minimal key length. I recall that for WEP, the passphrase is converted via MD5 to produce key. But the question's options: 30, 26, 10, 16 hex digits. The initial minimum key length is probably 16 hex digits because 64-bit key requires 16 hex digits. However, passphrase-based?

SPA can directly observe patterns on power trace and deduce key with single trace. DPA requires statistical analysis of many traces. Option C says DPA requires statistical analysis of tens of traces, while SPA only needs one or few traces for correlation analysis. Wait correlation usage? SPA uses direct observation, not correlation. Option D: DPA exploits power consumption variations based on data processed, while SPA studies the key-dependent features. This is less precise. The distinguishing factor: DPA uses many traces and statistical analysis; SPA uses a single trace (or few) and direct observation. The choice that expresses that is C: DPA requires statistical analysis of tens of traces, while SPA only needs one or a few traces for correlation analysis. But option C says \"correlation analysis\" for SPA, which is inaccurate. But likely they want C. Option D: DPA exploits power consumption variations based on data processed, while SPA studies the key-dependent features. That's also kind of correct: DPA uses data-dependent variations; SPA uses key-dependent features? Might be wrong.
